# Guido Cavalcanti, _Rhymes_ 
(Old Florentine, c. 1255–1300) 


The folder ```poesie``` contains the files of poems/sonnets in two formats: .conllu and .txt. It also includes a script to split the file containing all texts into individual files.
The folder ```trattato_amore``` contains the files of _Trattato d’amore_ in both .conllu and .txt formats. It also includes a script to split the file containing all the _poemetti_ into individual files.
```processTextFile.py``` is the script used to process the .txt files using the Stanza model.
Inside the ```poesie``` folder, the subfolder ```poesie_gold``` contains the sonnets manually annotated.

A description of the work can be found in: "What Is Better for Syntactic Parsing? A Comparison between Supervised and Unsupervised Models on Dante and Cavalcanti".
